ncurses:
	change 'w' and 'b' to toggle between /\s/ and !/\s/ like gui textboxes

	'u' (aka undo)

	^Vx[0-9]+ = hex char insert - ^Vx1 inserts '\x01'

	gui_getstr(): display non printable chars correctly on deletion
	/fix backspace on tabbed lines

regex:
	simple (vi(1) - see '/'): ^$.[]*

binary file handling? (i.e. '\0')

side scrolling with tabs - fix

fix i_S - currently joins with line below

cat <<! | uvi <<tim
hi
there
!
2dd
tim

store list of words after each buffer insertion, rather than generate
	buffer_getwords() - ->dirty etc etc

'nu'
'cindent' (aka just handle {} nesting)
'scs' aka smartcase search

fix 'ai' for ^[O
fix 'ai' for xyz\n\n\n<insert here> (fixed?)

auto indent for ^[r\n

buffer_write(): write to temp file, then rename into place

on d[motion above], position cursor to top

visual 'd' and 'c' commands (<, > and others too)

change > from [0-9]> to [0-9]>{motion}

intellisense file:
	first match: -x $PATH

fix :<range>! filtering - a new line appears from nowhere

uvi - :set ts=-5 // check

$ vim +help\ Visual-mode
^ check keys

:cd and :pwd - change buffer list to accomodate
	- copy vim
	- store absolute paths for all
	- store open directory fds, and use openat()

[cd]w deletes all whitespace

:tabnew :tn

:e %\t
