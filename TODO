change 'w' and 'b' to toggle between /\s/ and !/\s/ like gui textboxes

'u' (aka undo)

gui_getstr(): display non printable chars correctly on deletion
/fix backspace on tabbed lines

manual regex:
	simple (vi(1) - see '/'): ^$.[]*

binary file handling? (i.e. '\0')

side scrolling with tabs - fix

fix i_S - currently joins with line below
fix i_c$

store list of words after each buffer insertion, rather than generate
	buffer_getwords() - ->dirty etc etc

'nu'
'scs' aka smartcase search

fix 'ai' for ^[O
fix 'ai' for xyz\n\n\n<insert here> (fixed?)

auto indent for ^[r\n

buffer_write(): write to temp file, then rename into place

on d[motion above], position cursor to top

visual 'd' and 'c' commands (<, > and others too)
$ vim +help\ Visual-mode
^ check keys

intellisense file:
	first match: -x $PATH

:cd and :pwd - change buffer list to accomodate
either:
	- copy vim
	- store absolute paths for all
	- store open directory fds, and use openat()

[cd]w deletes all whitespace

:tabnew :tn (like :n, but keeps buffer in memory)

fix macros:
	map I i#include "
	map i i#include <

[vdc]i[[{etc]

$x

fix :so'ing maps
	- don't allow duplicates

fix :\t

fix regex matching - don't highlight by doing
for i = 0 ; i < len(str); i++
	if match then hl 1 char, then inc a char
instead, get all matches at once

scroll on :ls being > LINES
(scroll on :anything?)

fix detach (i.e. wyrd << e + sigwinch) bug

fix 2tx - it only goes to the first, obviously

ihi^V^J\e

store last motion for '.' command

fix :e abc\t cursor positioning

fix ma cursor pos

on 'p' goto the last inserted line, if inserting lines
