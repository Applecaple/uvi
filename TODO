ncurses:
	change 'w' and 'b' to toggle between /\s/ and !/\s/ like gui textboxes

	:e autocomplete?

	'u' (aka undo)

	Fix segfault on d'a, where a is marked as above current position

	SIGWINCH - handle

	^Vx[0-9]+ = hex char insert - ^Vx1 inserts '\x01'

	gui_getstr(): display non printable chars correctly on deletion

command.c:
	add range option to filters/pipes
	use $SHELL in shellout()

simple (vi(1) - see '/'): ^$.[]*

copy vim - change attributes on stdin (tcsetattr), so it works with poormanseperation.sh

binary file handling? - '\0' for e.g

side scrolling with tabs - fix

'nu'
fix backspace on tabbed lines
ddp

[[

* and #

~ is handled by buffer_read(), nowhere else
